In this lecture we learnt how flutter manages different trees to update UI efficiently , 
for example element tree tries to reuse as many as element as needed.
and render tree is only updated partially if differences bteween only and new are detected. 

And also learnt keys while working with stateful widget, which other wise loose their state if used without keys,because state would not move along with the widgets.
With keys it does, and in flutter we need to add keys to make it work correctly.
